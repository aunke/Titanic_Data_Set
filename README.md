# Titanic_Data_Set
Analysis of the Titanic dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information on passengers who were aboard the Titanic and whether or not they survived or not. It also contains information on what class the passenger was in, how much they paid for a ticket, the passengerâ€™s age, and whether or not they had family and/or siblings onboard. This project focused on learning more about the passengers on board the Titanic and analyzing how they compared with the other passengers in the 3 different classes.
This project was completed using Python Jupyter and focuses on using pandas as well as graphing the results with matplotlib.
